Introduction
============
Implement Car and Van booking functionality.

This code is designed to be bad! Actively highlight anything you don't like. Refactoring is encouraged; as long as I can still make a car or van booking through the BookingService.

Unit tests are desirable. Feel free to install another unit test runner and or any other packages as required.

Feel free to ask questions to the interviewers and treat us a pair programming buddies.

Feel free to use the Internet to look things up.

===============
Upon completion
===============
	1. discuss how you would go about implementing another booking type, say motorbikes.
	2. discuss how you would go about implementing a seasonal discount function
		e.g. In November, all Saloon and SUV Car get a 2-4-1 daily rate.
